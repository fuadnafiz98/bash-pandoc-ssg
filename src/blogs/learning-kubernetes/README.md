# Learning Kubernetes

Kubernetes is designed as a highly available cluster of computers / VMs that work together as a **single unit**. 

A kubernetes cluster is formed with 2 types of resources:

1.**Master**: which coordinates the cluster.
2.**Nodes**: where applications are run.



```cpp
console.log('hello world')
```
